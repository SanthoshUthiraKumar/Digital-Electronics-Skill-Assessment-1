# Digital-Electronics-Skill-Assessment-1
### AIM:
To design and simulate the logic diagram using Verilog and validate its output

### HARDWARE REQUIRED: â€“
PC, Cyclone II , USB flasher

### SOFTWARE REQUIRED:
Quartus prime

### THEORY
### Introduction
Logic gates are the basic building blocks of any digital system. Logic gates are electronic circuits having one or more than one input and only one output. The relationship between the input and the output is based on a certain logic. Based on this, logic gates are named as

AND gate, OR gate, NOT gate ,NAND gate, NOR gate, Ex-OR gate ,Ex-NOR gate

### Logic Diagram


### Logic Expression 
F=A'B'+C'D'+B'D


### Produre
### 1. Using AND gate and wires construct the circuit.
### 2. Find RTL Logic for the circuit
### 3. Find Timing Diagram for the Circuit
### 4. End the program

OUTPUT
RTL LOGIC


TIMING DIGRAMS



TRUTH TABLE


RESULTS
Thus the given circuit is designed and the truth table is verified using quartus software
